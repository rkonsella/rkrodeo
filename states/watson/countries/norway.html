			Alright… Sweden. I was in Gothenburg for almost five days (plus a one-day preview of Malmo taking a day trip from Copenhagen.
			Not gonna lie, the entire purpose was to go to a music festival called
			<a href="http://www.wayoutwest.se/en/" class="txt-riley-blue">Way Out West</a>. I saw the lineup, I’ve been trying to
			see Frank Ocean for years and thought, “eh, why not?”
		</p>
		<h4>What I Did</h4>
		<p>
			I got to see three days of music in a beautiful park called
			<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Slottsskogen,+Gothenburg,+Sweden/@57.686772,11.9224895,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x464ff33b655951cd:0x79a8df64b0f8f91f!8m2!3d57.6839662!4d11.9439226?hl=en"
			 class="txt-riley-blue">Slottsskogen</a>; three main stages and two smaller stages took up a portion of the park for
			the week. The festival was vegetertain, which I was surprised about, but I spent three days eating fried halloumi burgers,
			which was fine by me.
		</p>
		<p>
			Before and after the festival I spent some time exploring Gothenburg, including finding some really legit tacos at a restaurant
			opened by a Mexican woman from San Francisco (I miss Mexican food). Gothenburg was nice and hilly, lots of cool restaurants
			and bars, it would be a cool place to spend more than just a few days.
		</p>

		<h4>Who I Saw</h4>
		<p>
			Of course, the point of the festival was to see music. Luckily, some favorites were there.

		</p>
		<h5>Frank Ocean</h5>
		<p>
			The biggest reason to go. I’m a huge Frank Ocean fan (go listen to Channel Orange), and he doesn’t tour much so I hadn’t
			found a chance to see him before. He was great.
		</p>
		<h5>The xx</h5>
		<p>
			Another one I really like but hadn’t seen before. The xx was one of my favorite bands when their first album came out in
			2009, so this was long overdue.
		</p>
		<h5>Jens Lekman</h5>
		<p>
			Alright I hadn’t heard of him until I was told to listen to him like a week before the festival and he quickly became a favorite.
			No idea why I hadn’t listened to him before. Not only was he great, but he made it a point to have an all-female backing
			band, something I hadn’t seen before.
		</p>
		<h5>Others</h5>
		<p>
			Lots of other acts, too. Some I’m a fan of, others not so much. Let’s just throw them in two tiers, artists I actually like
			and those I don’t.
		</p>
		<p>
			I liked seeing The Shins, Danny Brown, Vince Staples, Mac DeMarco, Feist, Band of Horses, and Regina Spektor.
		</p>
		<p>
			I didn't really care about seeing Migos, Major Lazer, or Lana del Rey.
