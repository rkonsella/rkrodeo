		<p>
			After going to a music festival in Sweden, I decided to take one more little excursion before going to my next Watson country.
			I rented a car in Gothenburg, Sweden and drove to Ryfoss, Norway to spend a few nights at an Airbnb and go hiking. The
			main reason was to hike the famous <a href="https://www.visitnorway.com/listings/the-besseggen-ridge-in-jotunheimen/12343/"
			 class="txt-riley-blue">Besseggen Ridge trail</a>, one of the most beautiful hikes in Norway.

		</p>
		<p>
			So, I said I rented a car. But here’s the thing. The rest of the world doesn’t default to automatic transmission cars like
			the US does. Renting an automatic in Sweden costs at least twice as much as renting a manual transmission car. I had never
			driven manual before, but I wanted to save some money so… I went for it. I’m very proud to say I only stalled some 6 or
			7 times before getting it out of the parking lot.

		</p>
		<p>
			Honestly, it wasn’t that hard to figure out for the most part… Except when I had to go slow. Yeah I was really bad at that.
			So I found some side roads near the airport and practiced for a while before deciding to make the six-hour drive to the
			middle of Norway. But really, once I was on the highway, it was easy to drive. I got to notice the weird things about
			highways in Norway, how they differed in a lot of ways I didn’t realize. So here’s the Watson justification for the side
			trip unrelated to my Watson.
		</p>

		<h4>Difference 1: The highways were so small!</h4>
		<p>
			For the drive between Gothenburg and Oslo, I was on a pretty conventional freeway, with two lanes in either direction. Once
			I got past Oslo, however, everything changed. I was taking the primary highway connecting the two largest cities in Norway
			and for most of the drive the road only had a single lane shared for both directions. Whenever I passed a car going in
			the opposite direction, we both had to get all the way to the edge of the pavement on our right sides, giving each other
			half of the single lane. Luckily I actually didn’t pass cars that often. But I was surprised there was something else
			I passed less often.
		</p>



		<h4>Difference 2: Very few semi trucks</h4>
		<p class="p-l-sm">
			It would make sense for the shipping between Oslo and Bergen, two coastal cities, to be via the ocean, but I was still very
			surprised by the small number of large trucks I saw on the highway in Norway. In hindsight I wish I had kept track of
			the exact number, but I really feel like the number of semis I passed after Oslo would be countable on two hands. A hgihway
			connecting two midsize coastal US cities would have had tens of times more trucks. I’m sure this is part of the reason
			the roads are so small.
		</p>


		<h4>Difference 3: Really cool tunnels and bridges</h4>
		<p>
			The drive from Oslo to Ryfoss is really beautiful, with lots of natural beauty in the winding roads over lakes and gorges.
			But something else that made it fun to drive was the really well done infrastructure along the way. It started with some
			enormous suspension bridges over these coastal gorges in Sweden, and then continued with lots of tunnels through mountains
			in Norway. I was dreading driving through Oslo since I was incapable of driving slowly and I knew I’d be in the largest
			citiy in the country during rush hour, but it ended up alright since the highway actually tunnels underneath the entire
			city for some NUMBER HERE miles. I didn’t have to slow down through the city at all, I just went right past it. The only
			US city with anything remotely like this is Boston with it’s Big Dig project, and having driven through it more than a
			few times, I can assure you it is not traffic-free during rush hour. Later I went through many other tunnels, and actually
			passed one in the middle of construction, somewhere between making a giant hole through a mountain and paving a road through
			that hole. Everything was really interesting to see.
		</p>

		<p>
			As I mentioned before, this was some of the most beautiful driving of my life. The highway from Oslo to Ryfoss and then from
			Ryfoss to Besseggen Ridge were probably two of the top drives I’ve ever done, right up there with New Zealand Highway

			 class="txt-riley-blue">between Lakes Wanaka and Hawea</a>. But, of course I went there for the beauty, I just went
			for the hike. And the hike definitely did not disappoint.

		</p>
		<p>
			The Besseggen Ridge hike is traditionally a one-way hike; first you take a ferry across a lake and then you hike 14 kilometers
			back along the lake to where you started. It was probably the coolest hike I’ve ever done, just look at
			<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BX6VL8vlQ88/" class="txt-riley-blue">the pictures</a>. It would have been worth it
			just for the views, but it was actually a really fun hike, too. The ridge itself is a steep, 1km stretch of big boulders
			and small cliffs that requires a lot of pulling yourself up with your arms. It was easy enough to do, but lots of fun.
			The weather was perfect, too; it was the only window of decent weather in my four days in Norway.
		</p>
		<p>
			I’m really glad I did this trip since I had such a good time on the hike and learned a lot from driving in another country.
			I also learned a lot about how expensive everything is in rural Norway (everything is stupid expensive). And, now I know
			how to drive stick. So a win-win-win for sure. Now, onto the Netherlands.
