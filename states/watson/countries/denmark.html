		<p>
			On July 21 I finally began my Watson, “officially,” by visiting one of the cities I’ve been most looking forward to visit
			since I began planning my project: Copenhagen, Denmark. It’s an old city with lots of interesting history, but also now
			one of the most popular European destinations for its much younger vibe. But, of course, I was visiting for more than
			that. It’s the only city in the world where a majority of its citizens commute to work by bike. It was one of the first
			cities with a cohesive, long-term public transit and urban layout plan, called the “
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_Plan" class="txt-riley-blue">Finger Plan</a> .”
		</p>
		<p>
			I wanted to look at these two noteworthy aspects of Copenhagen transportation, so I spent my first week in an Airbnb outside
			of the city, where I’d have to commute using one of the “Finger” train routes, and then I spent the remainder of my time
			staying in the city center, getting around with a bike rental.
		</p>
		<h4>What I Did</h4>
		<p>
			I spend twenty days in Copenhagen, longer than I’ve consecutively stayed in any one city except the three I’ve lived in.
			Seeing as this was my first Watson country, I wasn’t sure exactly how to approach the city with respect to its infrastructure.
			I did all of the tourist things, of course: walked around Nyhavn, visited Christiania, joined a free walking tour, went
			to the top of Christiansborg Palace, toured the National Museum, saw the Little Mermaid statue… I also drank a lot of
			coffee while trying to work on this website in cafés, and ate a lot of street food. And of course, I met a lot of people
			at my hostel and around the city, both Danes and other tourists
		</p>

		<h4>Bicycles</h4>
		<p>
			The number one reason for visiting Copenhagen was the dedication to bikes. One of the Danes I met told me he doesn’t know
			a single person his age (late 20s) that doesn’t use a bike in their regular commute, and said he doesn’t have a friend
			that owns a car. The idea of using trains and bicycles to get around instead of cars is deeply ingrained in Copenhagen.

		</p>
		<p>
			This is large part because of how important bikes have been for the city historically. Bicycles have been the primary form
			of transport for the average Copenhagener since at least the 1920s, according to the National Museum. Because bikes have
			always been so important, they get priority in infrastructure, and because they get priority in infrastructure they remain
			extremely popular. Take a look at one particular bike path I noticed one day, in the Google Maps screenshot below. It’s
			a flyover, raised some 20 feet above the water and ground beneath it. Of course, there is a pedestrian path directly below
			it, that would have been perfectly acceptable for bikes as well, but instead the city built this dedicated bike flyover,
			over 600 feet long, because it was the <i>best</i> solution for cyclists in this situation. This dedication to bike
			infrastructure just doesn’t exist in the US, I honestly can’t think of a bridge of any kind dedicated to purely bicycles
			anywhere in Denver; let me know if I’m wrong.

		<h4>Public Transportation</h4>
		<p>
			Of course, bicycles can’t be the only form of transportation in a city, especially when they’re all the cruiser-style city
			bikes popular in European cities. It obviously becomes much harder to convince people to use only a bike when their trip
			is more than a few miles. So, Copenhagen also has a very robust public transportation system featuring some of the nicest
			trains I’ve seen on daily commute lines. The Metro system is relatively new, and is in the middle of a huge expansion
			that will more than double the length of the system and the number of stations. The systems are made to work well with
			bicycles; there are large bike parking areas at most of the stations and there is room for bikes on all trains. The entire
			system is really impressive, the city wouldn’t have the same levels of bike usage without the trains.
