	In March of 2017, I was one of 40 students across the U.S. awarded the Thomas J. Watson Fellowship as part of its 49th class.
	This came after a months-long application process involving a nomination for the fellowship by my school, dozens of iterations
	of my project, and constant revision of my application essays between my nomination and the application deadline.
</p>
<p>
	I proposed a project on transportation, a long-standing interest of mine with exciting new applications through developments
	in self-driving car technology and new commitments to sustainable transportation like bicycles and public transit. I wanted
	to learn about the ways that cities throughout the world have already embraced these new developments with the goal of finding
	ways to be more progressive with transportation in the United States.
</p>
<p>
	I left the U.S., alone, on July 13, 2017 and won't return for at least a full year. In the meantime, I'll be traveling (or
	have already traveled) to countries on four different continents to both learn about their transportation systems and spend
	time immersing myself in cultures very different than what I've grown up with back home. I get to explore the interest fueling
	my project, be a tourist in my project countries and nearby, and grow a little bit in the process.

	in my application for the fellowship. 
	<!-- I'll also be tracking the countries I visit on the map above, and below are summaries
	of my thoughts both as a tourist and a Watson Fellow on the time I've spent in each country. -->

	and links to social media like Twitter and Instagram are in the website footer. I'll be back in Colorado in late July 2018.
