	Below you'll find my project title and abstract
	<a href="https://watson.foundation/fellowships/tj/fellows/a0C0G00000SUsFSUA1" class="txt-riley-blue">as listed</a> on the
	Watson Foundation's website. For a little more depth, if you're curious, you can read the <a href="/assets/pdfs/Konsella_WatsonPersonalStatement_FINAL.pdf"
	 class="txt-riley-blue">personal statement</a> and
	<a href="/assets/pdfs/Konsella_WatsonProjectProposal_FINAL.pdf" class="txt-riley-blue">project proposal</a> that I included
	in my application for the fellowship. I'll also be tracking the countries I visit on the map above, and below are summaries
	of my thoughts both as a tourist and a Watson Fellow on the time I've spent in each country.
