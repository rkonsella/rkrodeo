	In March of 2017, I was one of 40 students across the U.S. awarded the Thomas J. Watson Fellowship as part of its 49th class.
	This came after a months-long application process involving a nomination for the fellowship by my school, dozens of iterations
	of my project, and constant revision of my application essays between my nomination and the application deadline.
</p>
<p class="m-a-xs">The basic rules:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Must leave the US for a full year</li>
		<li>Spend only money provided by the Watson Foundation</li>
		<li>Don't go anywhere unsafe</li>
		<li>No traveling with people you know before the fellowship</li>
		<li>Do your best to remain driven by your project</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The idea is to foster a environment of daily challenges and discomfort to help the fellows grow as people. Each fellow designs
	a project that guides them along the way, helping the decision of where to go and providing motivation.
</p>
<p>
	I proposed a project on transportation, a long-standing interest of mine with exciting new applications through developments
	in self-driving car technology and new commitments to sustainable transportation like bicycles and public transit. I wanted
	to learn about the ways that cities throughout the world have already embraced these new developments with the goal of finding
	ways to be more progressive with transportation in the United States.
</p>
<p>
	I left the U.S., alone, on July 13, 2017 and won't return for at least a full year. In the meantime, I'll be traveling (or
	have already traveled) to countries on four different continents to both learn about their transportation systems and spend
	time immersing myself in cultures very different than what I've grown up with back home. I get to explore the interest fueling
	my project, be a tourist in my project countries and nearby, and grow a little bit in the process.

	<!-- I'll also be tracking the countries I visit on the map above, and below are summaries
	of my thoughts both as a tourist and a Watson Fellow on the time I've spent in each country. -->

	July 2018.

				<span class="text-muted">Steering Offbeat Transportation Solutions through Human Pushback
			</h4>
			<p>From cars and bicycles in Norway and Denmark to motorbikes and gondolas in Vietnam and Brazil, countries around the world
				have distinct approaches to transportation. I will experience the nuances of these systems and how transportation is
				evolving through the emergence of new technologies. Projects like self-driving cars in Singapore and autonomous drones
				in Rwanda signal the beginning of rapid and controversial changes in transportation. My Watson Fellowship will be spent
				investigating the fascinating ways in which governments solve traffic and transportation problems, and how citizens react
				to these changes through advocacy or resistance.
