		<p>
			Berlin was my first destination on the year I’m spending internationally for my Watson fellowship, though it actually wasn’t
			part of of my fellowship and the corresponding project on transportation. Instead, I was going to Berlin to present a
			workshop paper at the Association for Computing Machinery’s Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, or
			<a href="http://gecco-2017.sigevo.org/index.html/HomePage" class="txt-riley-blue">GECCO</a>. That was the focus of my
			week in Germany, though I made sure to find time for other things as well.
		</p>
		<p>
			Of all of the places I’ll be visiting while on my Watson year, Berlin is one of two (along with Amsterdam) that I’ll have
			visited previously. I went to Berlin last December for a week after visiting some friends on a study abroad in Prague,
			and really enjoyed the vibe of the city and some of the tourist attractions I visited, like the Berlin Wall Memorial and
			the Neues Museum. This time, with GECCO and the Watson in mind, I made sure to put a little bit of my focus on the conference,
			but also in meeting people and exploring the city and its transportation systems.
		</p>
		<h4>What I Did</h4>
		<p>
			I was in Berlin for seven days, one day longer than planned because of a transportation issue (more on that later). I went
			to GECCO for four days, but I usually left at lunch. I had met some cool people in my hostel (top center), and we did
			things like go swimming in a

			 class="txt-riley-blue">floating pool</a> in the river Spree (below). I went to some places myself, like the Altes Museum
			and Tompelhofer Field (top right).

		<h4>GECCO</h4>
		<p>
			The entire purpose of my visit was to present a paper at GECCO’s SimER workshop on robotics simulators, written by my senior
			project advisor at Union, John Rieffel, as well as myself and two other graduating students. But I also got to attend
			a conference for the first time, and learned about things like smart cities in presentations, and attended three keynotes,
			including the main keynote by
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hod_Lipson" class="txt-riley-blue">Hod Lipson</a>. It was cool to go to a conference,
			and to present, but most of the workshops and paper presentations that I attended were a little over my head.
		</p>
		<h4>Transportation</h4>
		<p>
			Of course, even though I wasn’t going to Berlin for the Watson, I was eying all of the transportation, because that’s just
			what I do. Though Berlin isn’t necessarily known for it, they have a fantastic public transportation system featuring
			buses, trams, above-ground trains, and a subway system. You can get anywhere in the city in half an hour, which is crazy.
			Bike culture is small compared to the Netherlands or Denmark, but enormous compared to anywhere in the US. There are dedicated
			bike lanes on most major roads.
		</p>
		<p>
			As good as the transportation system is, though, I ended up stuck in Germany for an extra day because of an issue with the
			train. I was trying to get to the Berlin bus station, where I had a ticket to get to Copenhagen by bus, but on the way
			there, the train tracks were suddenly shut down at a really inconvenient point, preventing me from getting across the
			city to the bus station in time. The tracks remained closed for the entire afternoon, and I had to buy a new bus ticket
			for the next day and get a hostel for one more night. Oh well, I like Berlin. Not the worst place in the world to end
			up stuck for a night.
