		<h5 class="text-muted m-b-sm">This fellowship is a one-of-a-kind opportunity for students graduating from college to spend a year traveling the world
			and exploring a personal interest in the process. Read about the fellowship on the Watson Foundation's website
			<a href="https://watson.foundation/fellowships/tj" class="txt-riley-blue">here</a>.

		<p>
			In March of 2017, I was one of 40 students across the U.S. awarded the Thomas J. Watson Fellowship as part of its 49th class.
			This came after a months-long application process involving a nomination for the fellowship by my school, dozens of iterations
			of my project, and constant revision of my application essays between my nomination and the application deadline.
		</p>
		<p>
			I proposed a project on transportation, a long-standing interest of mine with exciting new applications through developments
			in self-driving car technology and new commitments to sustainable transportation like bicycles and public transit. I wanted
			to learn about the ways that cities throughout the world have already embraced these new developments with the goal of
			finding ways to move forward on transportation in the United States.
		</p>
		<p>
			I left the U.S., alone, on July 13, 2017 and won't return for at least a full year. In the meantime, I'll be traveling (or
			have already traveled to) countries on four different continents to both learn about their transportation systems and
			spend time immersing myself in cultures very different than what I've grown up with back home. I get to explore that interest
			fueling the project, be a tourist in my project countries and nearby, and grow a little myself in the process.
		</p>
		<p>
			Below you'll find my project title and abstract
			<a href="https://watson.foundation/fellowships/tj/fellows/a0C0G00000SUsFSUA1" class="txt-riley-blue">as listed</a> on
			the Watson Foundation's website. For a little more depth, if you're curious, you can read the <a href="/assets/pdfs/Konsella_WatsonPersonalStatement_FINAL.pdf"
			 class="txt-riley-blue">personal statement</a> and
			<a href="/assets/pdfs/Konsella_WatsonProjectProposal_FINAL.pdf" class="txt-riley-blue">project proposal</a> that I included
			in my application for the fellowship. I'll also be tracking the countries I visit on the map below, with summaries of
			my thoughts on the time I've spent in each country, both as a tourist and as a Watson Fellow.

			If you have any questions, let me know. You can find a number of ways to contact me at the very bottom of this page. I'll
			be back in Colorado in late July, 2018.

					<h4>Stuck in Traffic: <span class="text-muted">Steering Offbeat Transportation Solutions through Human Pushback</h4>
					<p class="text-muted">From cars and bicycles in Norway and Denmark to motorbikes and gondolas in Vietnam and Brazil, countries around the
						world have distinct approaches to transportation. I will experience the nuances of these systems and how transportation
						is evolving through the emergence of new technologies. Projects like self-driving cars in Singapore and autonomous
						drones in Rwanda signal the beginning of rapid and controversial changes in transportation. My Watson Fellowship will
						be spent investigating the fascinating ways in which governments solve traffic and transportation problems, and how
						citizens react to these changes through advocacy or resistance.</p>
