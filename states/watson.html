						<h4>
							<span class="_600">Stuck in Traffic: </span>
							<span class="text-muted">Steering Offbeat Transportation Solutions through Human Pushback
						</h4>
						<p>From cars and bicycles in Norway and Denmark to motorbikes and gondolas in Vietnam and Brazil, countries around the
							world have distinct approaches to transportation. I will experience the nuances of these systems and how transportation
							is evolving through the emergence of new technologies. Projects like self-driving cars in Singapore and autonomous
							drones in Rwanda signal the beginning of rapid and controversial changes in transportation. My Watson Fellowship will
							be spent investigating the fascinating ways in which governments solve traffic and transportation problems, and how
							citizens react to these changes through advocacy or resistance.
